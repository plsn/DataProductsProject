## Overview of this ShinyApp

- There are a total of 49 numbers out of which 6 numbers are drawn in each week's lottery game
- The entry game is called System 6, whereby you select 6 numbers
- Next is System 7, 8 or 9, whereby you can select 7, 8 or 9 numbers respectively which gives you a higher chance of winning compared to System 6 but of course will cost more to play
